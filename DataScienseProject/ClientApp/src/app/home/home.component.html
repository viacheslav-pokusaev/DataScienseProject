    SVM is one of the most popular methods for model building. Instead of reading scientific
    books, just look at how it really works. You need only just click 2 buttons: Show example
    -> Create Model <br>
    The example uses data from the very famous dataset - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set">Fisher's Irises</a>.
    The goal - identify the type of iris by the size of the leaf. Check it,  is it possible?!

  <h2>
    How does SVM work?
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are a lot of articles with detailed math explanations like
    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html">this </a> or
    <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/">that</a>.
    We want to say only a general idea - the SVM method tries to find the answer to two questions:<br>
    1. Could two or more groups of points be split correctly using some geometric figure? The simplest case is using line.<br>
    2. Which figure (line) is the best one?<br>
    How to determine "the best line"? SVM thinks that the best line should be as far from both groups of points as possible.<br>
    In plot #2 you can see 5 lines that SVM found after the first iteration. Legend contains distance from each line to the points.
    Obviously that now the best one line has 0.145 (virtual unites) to the nearest point.
    Now time to improve our model.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Model improving
  </h2>
  <p>
    Before the improving model I want notice that you can change the count of resulted lines. I think that best count of models is
    from 5 to 10. I select 10 models, but you can try your's.<br>
    Click button 'Improve model'.<br>
    Now the best distance is 0.1575. Cool!<br>
    That's time to explain the last plot. Mathematicians say that each line in the Decart coordinate system could be determined by
    the slope to the Ox axis and the intercept with Oy axis. More details see
    <a href="http://www.math.com/school/subject2/lessons/S2U4L2GL.html">here</a>.
    So each point on this plot is a potential line. The color shows the distance from this line to the two groups of points. Then the lightest
    point is better. Red points are our solutions.<br>
    As you can see Sentosa and Versicolor were easily separated one from another because there is a big
    distance between two groups of points. What happened if two groups of points are mixed up? Good
    question! Let's try to do that.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>
    Mixed groups
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's back to our Shiny application, to the Step#3 and change Sentosa to the Virginica in the first drop-down list. Now we can recreate and improve model using familiar buttons.
